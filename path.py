def path_exists(node1, node2):
    '''Finds if there is a path between the two nodes that only includes 
    nodes that share the same owner. Uses Dijkstra's shortes path algorithm
    that terminates as soon as any path from [node1] to [node2] is found, since
    we are only interested in whether there is a path or not. All edges are 
    assumed to have a distance of 1.
    Returns a boolean.

    Precondition: [node1] and [node2] both belong to the same player.
